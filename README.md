## Using MCP with Claude

Once configured, you can ask Claude to create memes:

```
Create a meme using the "Drake" template with "Writing code" and "Making memes" as text.
```

or

```
Make a meme about debugging code for hours only to find a simple typo.
```

## Available Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `imgflip_search_memes` | Search for meme templates |
| `imgflip_get_template_info` | Get template details |
| `imgflip_create_meme` | Create a meme with custom text |
| `imgflip_generate_search_terms` | Generate search terms for concepts |
| `imgflip_create_from_concept` | Create a meme from a concept |


## Development

### Building and Publishing

To prepare the package for distribution:

1. Sync dependencies and update lockfile:
```bash
uv sync
```

2. Build package distributions:
```bash
uv build
```

This will create source and wheel distributions in the `dist/` directory.

3. Publish to PyPI:
```bash
uv publish
```

Note: You'll need to set PyPI credentials via environment variables or command flags:
- Token: `--token` or `UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN`
- Or username/password: `--username`/`UV_PUBLISH_USERNAME` and `--password`/`UV_PUBLISH_PASSWORD`

### Debugging

Since MCP servers run over stdio, debugging can be challenging. For the best debugging
experience, we strongly recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector).


You can launch the MCP Inspector via [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) with this command:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv --directory <PATH_TO_PROJECT_DIR> run imgflip-mcp
```


Upon launching, the Inspector will display a URL that you can access in your browser to begin debugging.
